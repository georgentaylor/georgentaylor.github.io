    Hi! I study the political economy of development. I am interested in
    how cultural norms and institutions shape adaptation to climate
    change, and how households make decisions about political
    participation.

<i>Against My Better Judgement: Gender, Norms and Political Expression
in the Household</i>
</summary>
<p>
Recent work has proposed household cooperation as a paradigm for
understanding the gender gap in political participation in South Asia,
which includes, but is not limited to, voting. Household members with
the most bargaining power (men) dictate voting behaviour and exclude
those with low bargaining power (women) from non-voting forms of
participation. I propose a simple model of political participation in
which spouses have imperfect information about the current level of
provision of local public goods and face identity costs for
norm-breaking behaviour. Depending on the accuracy of their spouses
signal and their own, they are able to (a) propose an investment in a
specific public good; or (b) defer to their spouse. From this model, I
derive testable predictions of the conditions under which women’s
preferences may be expressed. In particular, when norm costs are high, a
woman’s preferences are only expressed when her knowledge is perceived
to be much better than her husband’s. To verify these predictions, I
propose a randomised controlled trial in which spouses are randomly
treated with true information about the quality of their spouse’s
knowledge.
