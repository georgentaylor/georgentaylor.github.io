    Hi! I am a predoc at Yale interested in the political economy of
    development. At the moment, I am particularly interested in how
    households make decisions about political participation.

<summary><i>Against My Better Judgement: Gender, Norms and Political Expression in the Household</i></summary>
<p>Recent work has proposed household cooperation as a paradigm for understanding the gender gap in political participation in South Asia, which includes, but is not limited to, voting. Household members with the most bargaining power (men) dictate voting behaviour and exclude those with low bargaining power (women)  from non-voting forms of participation. I propose a simple model of political participation in which spouses have imperfect information about the current level of provision of local public goods and face identity costs for norm-breaking behaviour. Depending on the accuracy of their spouses signal and their own, they are able to (a) propose an investment in a specific public good; or (b) defer to their spouse. From this model, I derive testable predictions of the conditions under which women's preferences may be expressed. In particular, when norm costs are high, a woman's preferences are only expressed when her knowledge is perceived to be much better than her husband's. To verify these predictions, I propose a randomised controlled trial in which spouses are randomly treated with true information about the quality of their spouse's knowledge.</p>

<p>I am from the UK and a big defender of British food. I am also a
vegan (so cannot eat any British food). In my free time, I am learning
Hindi and trying to get better at cooking.</p>
