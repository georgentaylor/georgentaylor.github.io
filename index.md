<summary><i>Agricultural Productivity Impacts of Floods: Evidence From India</i> <br> 
with Vineet Gupta, Maulik Jagnani, and Rohini Pande</summary>
<p>Since 1980, the frequency of floods globally has quadrupled, disproportionately impacting India’s subsistence population. Floods threaten just under a third of India’s population, about 390 million people, half of whom rely on agriculture for a living. This study uses satellite data from 2000 to 2018 to provide causal estimates of the dynamic impacts of flooding on Indian agriculture. Using an event-study research design for an all-India sample spanning 2000-2018, we find that flooded areas lose 9.0% (3.3 percentage points (pp)) of agricultural output during the contemporaneous Kharif (monsoon) agricultural season and 8.2% (2.2 pp) in the subsequent
Rabi (winter) season. We find that damages worsen with flood duration. Rarely flooded regions suffer the most during longer inundation, whereas often flooded regions show much smaller
impacts, suggesting that experience pays off through adaptation. Strikingly, in all cases, agricultural yields rebound to pre-flood levels within a year. We supplement the all-India analysis
with evidence on the agricultural impact of the 2008 Kosi River floods in Bihar, India, which
occurred when the river breached its embankments and shifted course, inundating areas that
had not seen major flooding in the past half century. Spatial regression discontinuity estimates
show that flooded regions lost 57.4% (27.0 pp) of Kharif output and 52.2% (14.8 pp) of Rabi
output compared to neighboring areas, with impacts scaling with flood duration but, again,
fading within one year.</p>

<summary><i>Against My Better Judgement: Gender, Norms and Political Expression in the Household</i></summary>
<p>Recent work has proposed household cooperation as a paradigm for understanding the gender gap in political participation in South Asia, which includes, but is not limited to, voting. Household members with the most bargaining power (men) dictate voting behaviour and exclude those with low bargaining power (women)  from non-voting forms of participation. I propose a simple model of political participation in which spouses have imperfect information about the current level of provision of local public goods and face identity costs for norm-breaking behaviour. Depending on the accuracy of their spouses signal and their own, they are able to (a) propose an investment in a specific public good; or (b) defer to their spouse. From this model, I derive testable predictions of the conditions under which women's preferences may be expressed. In particular, when norm costs are high, a woman's preferences are only expressed when her knowledge is perceived to be much better than her husband's. To verify these predictions, I propose a randomised controlled trial in which spouses are randomly treated with true information about the quality of their spouse's knowledge.</p>
